Prossa offers several methods to assist with different aspects of data preprocessing:


1. `check_categorical_data(df)`: Check categorical data in the dataset.
2. `check_constant_columns(df)`: Check for constant columns in the dataset.
3. `check_imputation(df)`: Check for imputation and get recommendations.
4. `check_data_types(df)`: Check data types in the dataset.

Each of these methods takes a pandas DataFrame as an argument and returns relevant information or recommendations.
